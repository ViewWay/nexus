# Apache Groovy

Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language with static type and static compilation capabilities. It provides concise syntax and can integrate smoothly with any existing Java application.

Spring Framework provides a dedicated `ApplicationContext` that supports Groovy-based Bean definition DSL. For more details, see Groovy Bean Definition DSL.

Further support for Groovy, including beans written in Groovy, refreshable script beans, and more, can be found in Dynamic Language Support.
